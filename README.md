# Lung_Disease_Prediction

This project is designed to predict lung diseases, specifically pneumonia. It
includes a user-friendly web page where users can upload their X-ray images.
The project uses deep learning models, specifically the pre-defined VGG16
architecture, which is a 16-layer deep neural network based on Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN). VGG16 has a total of 138 million parameters, making it
an extensive network. The dataset used for training includes a large number of
X-ray images, with a focus on pneumonia-affected images and non-pneumonia
images. The project boasts a 98% accuracy in predicting whether an X-ray
shows signs of pneumonia. After the code is developed, it is saved as a model
and connected with Flask.
